## üìè Perimeters
Date Completed: ***2025-07-13***  
Participant: Peter Pan ***Panbear*** (w/ assistance of [**Martin Barbosa**](https://github.com/mar7inb))  
Simulated Environment: `LOG(N) Pacific - Cyber Range 1`  
Infected Host VMs: `michaelvm`, `centralsrvr`  
Suspected Time Frame: ***June 14 ‚Äì 18, 2025***  
Frameworks Applied: ***MITRE ATT&CK***, ***NIST 800-61***

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Overview

What appeared to be an isolated breach may have been a decoy. The adversary has returned‚Äîmore evasive, more strategic. This hunt tracks signs of PowerShell misuse, sensitive file access, and LOLBin-based persistence across two VMs: `michaelvm` and `centralsrvr`. 

<hr style="height: 4px; background-color: grey; border: none; margin-top: 40px;">

## üß≠ Attack Matrix Overview

The adversary executed malicious PowerShell via a user-level entry point, bypassing script restrictions to deploy a custom payload on ***michaelvm***. Reconnaissance identified privileged accounts and accessed critical financial documents. ***LOLBins*** (bitsadmin.exe, mshta.exe) downloaded tools, with persistence via registry autorun keys and scheduled tasks. Lateral movement to ***centralsrvr*** used stolen credentials and remote scheduled tasks, targeting sensitive files for exfiltration to Google Drive, Dropbox, and public paste sites. A PowerShell downgrade disabled logging, and event logs were cleared to block forensics.

## üí† Diamond Model Analysis

| Feature        | Details                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary**  | Hands-on-keyboard actor or red team using stealthy, multi-stage tactics. Skilled in LOLBins, evasion, and lateral movement. |
| **Infrastructure** | External C2 via `drive.google.com`, `dropbox.com`, `pastebin.com` (`104.22.69.199`). Used LOLBins (`bitsadmin.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) for delivery and execution. |
| **Capability** | PowerShell with execution policy bypass and v2 downgrade for AMSI evasion. Employed recon (`net group`), ADS payloads, scheduled tasks, and registry persistence. Exfiltrated data via cloud services. |
| **Victim**     | Initial target: `michaelvm`. Lateral target: `centralsrvr`. Accessed `QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx` on both. Abused sensitive folders and scheduled tasks for persistence. |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The Lurker intrusion was a sophisticated, multi-phase attack starting with PowerShell abuse and LOLBins, escalating to targeted data exfiltration. The adversary used stealth tactics‚Äîregistry persistence, scheduled tasks, AMSI evasion, and log clearing‚Äîto maintain access and cover tracks. Forensic analysis of process, file, registry, and network events reconstructed the kill chain across `michaelvm` and `centralsrvr`, revealing a focus on financial data (`QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx`).

<hr style="height: 4px; background-color: grey; border: none; margin-top: 40px;">

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned
- **Initial Access**: PowerShell with bypass flags in user folders signals compromise, even if it mimics legitimate use.
- **LOLBin Abuse**: Native tools (`bitsadmin.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) evade EDR detection.
- **Persistence**: Layered use of registry keys and scheduled tasks ensures reboot survival.
- **Exfiltration**: Cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, Pastebin) bypass traditional network filters.
- **Evasion**: PowerShell v2 downgrade disables AMSI and logging.
- **Log Clearing**: Despite attempts to erase logs, forensic artifacts enabled attack reconstruction.

## ‚õ® Remediation Actions
1. **PowerShell Security**:
   - Enforce Constrained Language Mode and block PowerShell v2.
   - Enable deep script block logging with centralized collection.
2. **LOLBin Controls**:
   - Alert on unusual `mshta.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` activity.

3. **Persistence Mitigation**:
   - Monitor `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` for unauthorized changes.
   - Detect non-admin scheduled task creation.
4. **Network Restrictions**:
   - Block unapproved cloud services (e.g., Dropbox, Pastebin).
   - Deploy CASB/DLP for cloud traffic inspection.
5. **Lateral Movement Defense**:
   - Audit `schtasks.exe` with `/S` flag.
   - Enforce MFA and reduce admin privileges.
6. **Log Protection**:
   - Alert on `wevtutil cl` activity.
   - Forward logs to a tamper-resistant SIEM.

**What to Hunt:** File activity in the Temp folder over a 2-3 day period starting June 15, 2025, to identify the attack‚Äôs origin.  
**TTP:** Execution of malicious files from temporary directories.  
**Why It Matters:** Identifying the initial compromised machine provides the starting point for tracing the attacker‚Äôs activities across the environment.  

**KQL Query:**
```
let startTime = datetime(2025-06-15 00:00:00);
let endTime = datetime(2025-06-18 23:59:59);
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (startTime .. endTime)
| where FolderPath has_any ("Temp")
| summarize
    FileCreated = countif(ActionType == "FileCreated"),
    FileAccessed = countif(ActionType == "FileAccessed"),
    FileCopied = countif(ActionType == "FileCopied"),
    FileMoved = countif(ActionType == "FileMoved"),
    FileDeleted = countif(ActionType == "FileDeleted")
    by DeviceName
| sort by FileCreated desc
```
**Output:** `michaelvm`  
**Finding:** By querying the ‚ÄúDeviceName‚Äù in `Sentinel` with a sorted list by ‚Äú`FileCreated`‚Äù count in ascending order, a manageable list of 85 entries got siphoned out. The output ‚Äú`michaelvm`‚Äù identifies the first VM compromised, marking the beginning of the threat hunting process.
