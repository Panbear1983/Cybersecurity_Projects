Date Completed: ***2025-07-13***  
Participant: Peter Pan ***Panbear*** (w/ assistance of [**Martin Barbosa**](https://github.com/mar7inb))  
Simulated Environment: `LOG(N) Pacific - Cyber Range 1`  
Infected Host VMs: `michaelvm`, `centralsrvr`  
Suspected Time Frame: ***June 14 ‚Äì 18, 2025***  
Frameworks Applied: ***MITRE ATT&CK***, ***NIST 800-61***

<hr style="height: 4px; background-color: grey; border: none; margin-top: 40px;">

## üìÑ Overview

The adversary executed malicious PowerShell via a user-level entry point, bypassing script restrictions to deploy a custom payload on `michaelvm`. Reconnaissance identified privileged accounts and accessed critical financial documents. ***LOLBins*** (bitsadmin.exe, mshta.exe) downloaded tools, with persistence via registry autorun keys and scheduled tasks. Lateral movement to ***centralsrvr*** used stolen credentials and remote scheduled tasks, targeting sensitive files for exfiltration to Google Drive, Dropbox, and public paste sites. A PowerShell downgrade disabled logging, and event logs were cleared to block forensics.

## ‚õ® Remediation Actions
1. **PowerShell Security**:
   - Enforce Constrained Language Mode and block PowerShell v2.
   - Enable deep script block logging with centralized collection.
2. **LOLBin Controls**:
   - Alert on unusual `mshta.exe`, `bitsadmin.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` activity.
   - Implement allow-listing for legitimate LOLBin use.
3. **Persistence Mitigation**:
   - Monitor `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` for unauthorized changes.
   - Detect non-admin scheduled task creation.
4. **Network Restrictions**:
   - Block unapproved cloud services (e.g., Dropbox, Pastebin).
   - Deploy CASB/DLP for cloud traffic inspection.
5. **Lateral Movement Defense**:
   - Audit `schtasks.exe` with `/S` flag.
   - Enforce MFA and reduce admin privileges.
6. **Log Protection**:
   - Alert on `wevtutil cl` activity.
   - Forward logs to a tamper-resistant SIEM.

<hr style="height: 4px; background-color: grey; border: none; margin-top: 40px;">

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned
- **Initial Access**: PowerShell with bypass flags in user folders signals compromise, even if it mimics legitimate use.
- **LOLBin Abuse**: Native tools (`bitsadmin.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) evade EDR detection.
- **Persistence**: Layered use of registry keys and scheduled tasks ensures reboot survival.
- **Exfiltration**: Cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, Pastebin) bypass traditional network filters.
- **Evasion**: PowerShell v2 downgrade disables AMSI and logging.
- **Log Clearing**: Despite attempts to erase logs, forensic artifacts enabled attack reconstruction.

<hr style="height: 4px; background-color: grey; border: none; margin-top: 40px;">

##  Conclusion
The Lurker intrusion was a sophisticated, multi-phase attack starting with PowerShell abuse and LOLBins, escalating to targeted data exfiltration. The adversary used stealth tactics‚Äîregistry persistence, scheduled tasks, AMSI evasion, and log clearing‚Äîto maintain access and cover tracks. Forensic analysis of process, file, registry, and network events reconstructed the kill chain across `michaelvm` and `centralsrvr`, revealing a focus on financial data (`QuarterlyCryptoHoldings.docx`).
