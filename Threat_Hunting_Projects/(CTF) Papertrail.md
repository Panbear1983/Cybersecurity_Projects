## üìÑ Overview

An insider masqueraded HR automation to tamper with performance records and bury audit evidence. The actor used **PowerShell** with execution-policy bypass, blended actions under an **HRTools** directory, queried local/privileged accounts, and reviewed credential-rich artifacts created via **rundll32 + comsvcs.dll**. They **disabled Defender runtime**, **modified Defender policy** via registry, beaconed outbound to **Azure Blob**/Pipedream (`*.core.windows.net`, `*.pipedream.net`), established persistence with a **legacy-themed script**, and attempted **audit-log and history cleanup**. Despite anti-forensics, the reconstructed timeline exposes motive around **promotion data** manipulation and personnel file targeting.

| Feature        | Details                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary**  | Insider / red-team emulating insider. Hands-on-keyboard, comfortable with PS tradecraft, LOLBins, and anti-forensics. |
| **Infrastructure** | Outbound to **Azure Blob** (`*.core.windows.net`) and **Pipedream** (`*.pipedream.net`). LOLBins used locally (`wevtutil.exe`, `qwinsta.exe`). |
| **Capability** | PowerShell (bypass), account & group discovery, **rundll32 + comsvcs.dll** memory access, Defender runtime disable + registry policy change, persistence via autorun script. |
| **Victim**     | Primary: **`n4thani3l-vm`**; naming variant overlap with **`nathan-i3l-vm`** leveraged for camouflage during discovery. Target data tied to HR personnel and promotion artifacts. |

## ‚õ® Remediation Actions
1. **PowerShell Guardrails**
   - Enforce **Constrained Language Mode**; block PowerShell v2; enable **Script Block** + **Module** logging to central SIEM.
2. **Defender Hardening**
   - Alert on `Set-MpPreference`/`MpCmdRun` tampering; lock registry keys for Defender policy; baseline **Disable**-prefixed values.
3. **HRTools Path Controls**
   - Monitor `C:\HRTools\**` for unusual writes/exec (non-signed, user-context); require signing for automation scripts.
4. **Credential Dumping Detections**
   - Create rules for `rundll32.exe` loading `comsvcs.dll`; alert on `lsass.exe` handles from non-system processes.
5. **Persistence Audits**
   - Watch `HKCU/HKLM\...\Run` for new/modified values executing PS/HTA; verify `OnboardTracker.ps1`-style names.
6. **Egress Controls**
   - Review allowlists for `*.core.windows.net`; restrict paste/test services (e.g., `*.pipedream.net`); deploy **CASB/DLP**.
7. **Anti-Forensics Alerts**
   - Alert on `wevtutil cl *`, `Clear-EventLog`, `ConsoleHost_history` touches; ship critical logs to write-once storage.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned
- **Camouflage Matters:** HR-themed folders and legacy names hide malicious PS activity in plain sight.  
- **Name Games:** Look-alike **device/account** names impede simple equals-filters‚Äînormalize and correlate behaviorally.  
- **Defense First:** Detect **Defender runtime + registry** tampering early; both commonly precede collection/exfil.  
- **Persistence is Boring on Purpose:** Plain `.ps1` under Run keys blends as ‚Äúbusiness tooling‚Äù.  
- **Anti-Forensics is Noisy:** `wevtutil cl` and history wipes still leave process/file/network breadcrumbs.  
- **Chain the Timeline:** Reconstructing **who ‚Üí what ‚Üí where ‚Üí when** beats chasing isolated IOCs.

## üèîÔ∏è Conclusion
‚ÄúPapertrail‚Äù illustrates a quiet insider blending with HR automation to alter records and prep a fraudulent promotion. By correlating **process**, **file**, **registry**, and **network** telemetry‚Äîdespite anti-forensics‚Äîwe surfaced the attack chain: **PS recon ‚Üí privilege scoping ‚Üí Defender weakening ‚Üí credential access ‚Üí outbound testing ‚Üí persistence ‚Üí data targeting ‚Üí audit disruption**. The outcome: a forensically sound timeline and concrete controls to prevent recurrence.

## üèÅ Hunting Flags

**Starting Point:** Initial Machine Identification
**Objective:** Determine the first machine touched via HR configs/scripts.
**What to Hunt:** .xml artifacts created by PowerShell between Aug 17‚Äì20, 2025.
**TTP:** Script-generated config drops in HR/operations paths via powershell.exe.
**Why It Matters:** Establishes the initial foothold and narrows the time/device scope for subsequent flags.

**KQL Query:**

***//Identify the initial compromised vm***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-17);
let EndTime = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "powershell.exe"
| where FileName has_any (".xml")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** n4thani3l-vm
**Finding:** The spoofed the legitmate VM `nathan-i3l-vm` with fake VM `n4thani3l-vm`. Filtering file events for PowerShell-driven .xml creation during the specified window surfaced entries consistent with script-generated configs rather than standard HR executables. The earliest such activity points to n4thani3l-vm, identified as the initial foothold host.

### Flag 1: Initial PowerShell Execution Detection

**Objective:** Pinpoint the earliest suspicious PowerShell activity marking the intruder‚Äôs entry.  
**What to Hunt:** PowerShell usage deviating from baseline, including lightweight reconnaissance like who.  
**TTP:** Command-and-scripting interpreter abuse (PowerShell) for environment awareness.  
**Why It Matters:** Establishes the first malicious process creation to anchor subsequent actions.  

**KQL Query:**  

***// Identify the initial suspicious process***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where AccountName contains "n4th4n13l"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "who"
| project Timestamp, InitiatingProcessParentCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCreationTime,
          DeviceName, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `2025-08-19T03:42:32.9389416Z`  
**Finding:** The earliest anomalous PowerShell activity appears at 03:42:32Z on Aug 19. Note the concurrent device-name spoofing (n4than-i3l-vm vs. n4thani3l-vm), which complicates host attribution and underscores the need to correlate across multiple telemetry types.  
<img width="1263" height="451" alt="Pasted Graphic 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83d4614e-a126-4ccd-a66e-b654538483c2" />

---

### Flag 2: Local Account Assessment

**Objective:** Confirm local identity enumeration following initial foothold.  
**What to Hunt:** Account discovery queries and associated process hashes.  
**TTP:** Local account reconnaissance to stage impersonation and privilege escalation.  
**Why It Matters:** Early identity mapping signals intent to pivot privileges or blend with legitimate users.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Identify the associated SHA256 value***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where AccountName has_any ("n4th4n13l", "n4th4n-13l")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, SHA256, InitiatingProcessSHA256
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `9785001b0dcf755eddb8af294a373c0b87b2498660f724e76c4d53f9c217c7a3`  
**Finding:** Multiple account-name variants (n4th4n13l, n4th4n-13l, N4th4n13L) appear, indicating alias spoofing during enumeration. The associated SHA256 above ties the activity to a specific process lineage.  
<img width="1275" height="559" alt="Pasted Graphic 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd6046b-9e55-4bf6-9198-e41204b5a0a6" />

---

### Flag 3: Privileged Group Assessment

**Objective:** Identify checks for elevated local administrators.  
**What to Hunt:** Group membership queries executed from PowerShell.  
**TTP:** Discovery of privileged groups to target admin accounts.  
**Why It Matters:** Reveals preparation for escalation and potential lateral movement.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Looking for the InitiatingCommandLine for privileged group***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "nathan-i3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("net","Get","who","local","admin","privilege","account","member","group")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `"powershell.exe" net localgroup Administrators`  
**Finding:** The actor leverages PowerShell to invoke net localgroup Administrators, enumerating local admins and surfacing accounts of interest such as n4th4n13l.  
<img width="1373" height="573" alt="Pasted Graphic 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b149480-c4ff-4662-9d68-b2b2f9309853" />

---

### Flag 4: Active Session Discovery

**Objective:** Identify enumeration of active sessions for potential piggybacking.  
**What to Hunt:** qwinsta or query session execution.  
**TTP:** Session discovery to blend operations with existing user contexts.  
**Why It Matters:** Riding live sessions reduces new-logon noise and helps evade detections.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Reveal active sessions for potential masking***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "nathan-i3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("qwinsta","query session")
| project FileName, InitiatingProcessFileName
```
**Output:** `qwinsta.exe`  
**Finding:** Use of qwinsta.exe confirms active session enumeration consistent with masquerading tactics.  
<img width="793" height="137" alt="Pasted Graphic 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e519a874-7685-4b1c-8918-af97065afa2e" />

---

### Flag 5: Defender Configuration Recon

**Objective:** Detect tampering with Defender runtime protections masked as HR activity.  
**What to Hunt:** PowerShell commands modifying Defender preferences.  
**TTP:** Defense evasion via Set-MpPreference and payload staging.  
**Why It Matters:** Disabling real-time monitoring enables subsequent credential access and exfiltration with reduced telemetry.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Investigate AV disablement disguised as HR activity***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "n4thani3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("powershell","union","defender","get","preference")
| project Timestamp, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
**Output:** `"powershell.exe" -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true; Start-Sleep -Seconds 1; Set-Content -Path "C:\Users\Public\PromotionPayload.ps1" -Value "Write-Host 'Payload Executed'"`  
**Finding:** The actor bypasses execution policy, disables real-time monitoring, inserts a brief delay, and drops a staged payload to C:\Users\Public\PromotionPayload.ps1.  
<img width="1713" height="60" alt="Pasted Graphic 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55808a0f-bcdd-48c0-82f3-abf6c235dcae" />

---

### Flag 6: Defender Policy Modification

**Objective:** Validate registry-level weakening of baseline protections.  
**What to Hunt:** Defender-related registry values set to disable protections.  
**TTP:** Persistent defense evasion by policy modification.  
**Why It Matters:** Policy changes survive reboots and degrade long-term detection.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Registry change indicating Defender disablement***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "n4thani3l-vm"
| where RegistryValueName contains "disable"
| project Timestamp, RegistryValueName
```
**Output:** `DisableAntiSpyware`  
**Finding:** Setting DisableAntiSpyware indicates intentional reduction of Defender coverage beyond runtime toggles.  
<img width="667" height="141" alt="Timestamp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cafec28f-cc4b-478a-a0de-33e5619e7f7f" />

# Flag Logic Flow:

Initial ‚Üí 1 üö©: "New system activity surfaced involving HRTools. Was initial enumeration conducted using PowerShell to assess privilege context?"  
1 ‚Üí 2 üö©: "Basic privilege data was revealed. Did the attacker move next to enumerate local user accounts to scope potential HR targets?"  
2 ‚Üí 3 üö©: "User listings are often followed by privilege pivoting. Was the local admin group queried to identify elevated accounts?"  
3 ‚Üí 4 üö©: "Recon suggests the attacker may be masking actions as legitimate HR activity. Did they check active sessions to piggyback on valid users?"  
4 ‚Üí 5 üö©: "To safely proceed, attackers often tamper with security tools. Is there evidence of Defender tampering or script drops that blend with HR automation?"  
5 ‚Üí 6 üö©: "Defender runtime protections aren't enough ‚Äî policy-level changes may suggest long-term access planning. Were registry-based settings altered?"  
6 ‚Üí 7 üö©: "With AV defenses lowered, was credential theft attempted? Is there LSASS access masked as HR config inspection via rundll32?"  
7 ‚Üí 8 üö©: "A dump was likely created. Did the attacker verify access to this disguised file? Were internal reviews simulated?"  
8 ‚Üí 9 üö©: "Once internal data is prepared, the next logical step is staging exfil. Is there a beacon or test GET request to verify outbound connectivity?"  
9 ‚Üí 10 üö©: "With outbound confirmed, sensitive data like PromotionCandidates.csv is Base64 encoded and sent ‚Äî was this file explicitly targeted for exfiltration?"  
10 ‚Üí 11 üö©: "Exfil indicates long-term plans. Did they register persistence using legacy HR scripts through autorun registry keys?"  
11 ‚Üí 12 üö©: "Persistence now enabled. Are there signs the attacker is repeatedly accessing specific HR performance artifacts (e.g., Carlos.Tanaka-Evaluation)?"  
12 ‚Üí 13 üö©: "The focus shifts to staging broader impact. Is PromotionCandidates.csv manipulated or tied to suspicious filtering?"  
13 ‚Üí 14 üö©: "With key content handled, anti-forensics takes priority. Is there bulk clearing of event logs to disrupt system audits?"  
14 ‚Üí 15 üö©: "Indicators show advanced cleanup ‚Äî PS history deletion, dummy Sysmon config drops, and HR registry trace removal all suggest attacker prepping to vanish."
