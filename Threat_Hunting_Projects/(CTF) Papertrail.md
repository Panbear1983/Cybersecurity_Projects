## üìÑ Overview

An insider masqueraded HR automation to tamper with performance records and bury audit evidence. The actor used **PowerShell** with execution-policy bypass, blended actions under an **HRTools** directory, queried local/privileged accounts, and reviewed credential-rich artifacts created via **rundll32 + comsvcs.dll**. They **disabled Defender runtime**, **modified Defender policy** via registry, beaconed outbound to **Azure Blob**/Pipedream (`*.core.windows.net`, `*.pipedream.net`), established persistence with a **legacy-themed script**, and attempted **audit-log and history cleanup**. Despite anti-forensics, the reconstructed timeline exposes motive around **promotion data** manipulation and personnel file targeting.

## üí† Diamond Model Analysis

| Feature        | Details                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary**  | Insider / red-team emulating insider. Hands-on-keyboard, comfortable with PS tradecraft, LOLBins, and anti-forensics. |
| **Infrastructure** | Outbound to **Azure Blob** (`*.core.windows.net`) and **Pipedream** (`*.pipedream.net`). LOLBins used locally (`wevtutil.exe`, `qwinsta.exe`). |
| **Capability** | PowerShell (bypass), account & group discovery, **rundll32 + comsvcs.dll** memory access, Defender runtime disable + registry policy change, persistence via autorun script. |
| **Victim**     | Primary: **`n4thani3l-vm`**; naming variant overlap with **`nathan-i3l-vm`** leveraged for camouflage during discovery. Target data tied to HR personnel and promotion artifacts. |

## ‚õ® Remediation Actions
1. **PowerShell Guardrails**
   - Enforce **Constrained Language Mode**; block PowerShell v2; enable **Script Block** + **Module** logging to central SIEM.
2. **Defender Hardening**
   - Alert on `Set-MpPreference`/`MpCmdRun` tampering; lock registry keys for Defender policy; baseline **Disable**-prefixed values.
3. **HRTools Path Controls**
   - Monitor `C:\HRTools\**` for unusual writes/exec (non-signed, user-context); require signing for automation scripts.
4. **Credential Dumping Detections**
   - Create rules for `rundll32.exe` loading `comsvcs.dll`; alert on `lsass.exe` handles from non-system processes.
5. **Persistence Audits**
   - Watch `HKCU/HKLM\...\Run` for new/modified values executing PS/HTA; verify `OnboardTracker.ps1`-style names.
6. **Egress Controls**
   - Review allowlists for `*.core.windows.net`; restrict paste/test services (e.g., `*.pipedream.net`); deploy **CASB/DLP**.
7. **Anti-Forensics Alerts**
   - Alert on `wevtutil cl *`, `Clear-EventLog`, `ConsoleHost_history` touches; ship critical logs to write-once storage.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned
- **Camouflage Matters:** HR-themed folders and legacy names hide malicious PS activity in plain sight.  
- **Name Games:** Look-alike **device/account** names impede simple equals-filters‚Äînormalize and correlate behaviorally.  
- **Defense First:** Detect **Defender runtime + registry** tampering early; both commonly precede collection/exfil.  
- **Persistence is Boring on Purpose:** Plain `.ps1` under Run keys blends as ‚Äúbusiness tooling‚Äù.  
- **Anti-Forensics is Noisy:** `wevtutil cl` and history wipes still leave process/file/network breadcrumbs.  
- **Chain the Timeline:** Reconstructing **who ‚Üí what ‚Üí where ‚Üí when** beats chasing isolated IOCs.

## üèîÔ∏è Conclusion
‚ÄúPapertrail‚Äù illustrates a quiet insider blending with HR automation to alter records and prep a fraudulent promotion. By correlating **process**, **file**, **registry**, and **network** telemetry‚Äîdespite anti-forensics‚Äîwe surfaced the attack chain: **PS recon ‚Üí privilege scoping ‚Üí Defender weakening ‚Üí credential access ‚Üí outbound testing ‚Üí persistence ‚Üí data targeting ‚Üí audit disruption**. The outcome: a forensically sound timeline and concrete controls to prevent recurrence.

## üèÅ Hunting Flags

### Starting Point: Initial Machine Identification
**Objective:** Determine the first machine touched via HR configs/scripts.  
**What to Hunt:** `.xml` artifacts created by PowerShell between **Aug 17‚Äì20, 2025**.  
**TTP:** Script-generated config drops in HR paths.  
**Why It Matters:** Establishes the initial foothold scope.  

**KQL Query:**

***//Identify the initial compromised vm***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-17);
let EndTime = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "powershell.exe"
| where FileName has_any (".xml")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `michaelvm`  
**Finding:** By querying the ‚ÄúDeviceName‚Äù in `Sentinel` with a sorted list by ‚Äú`FileCreated`‚Äù count in ascending order, a manageable list of 85 entries got siphoned out. The output ‚Äú`michaelvm`‚Äù identifies the first VM compromised, marking the beginning of the threat hunting process.

---

### Flag 1: Initial PowerShell Execution Detection

**Objective:** Pinpoint the earliest suspicious PowerShell activity marking the intruder‚Äôs entry.  
**What to Hunt:** PowerShell usage deviating from baseline, including lightweight reconnaissance like who.  
**TTP:** Command-and-scripting interpreter abuse (PowerShell) for environment awareness.  
**Why It Matters:** Establishes the first malicious process creation to anchor subsequent actions.  

**KQL Query:**  

***// Identify the initial suspicious process***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where AccountName contains "n4th4n13l"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "who"
| project Timestamp, InitiatingProcessParentCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCreationTime,
          DeviceName, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `2025-08-19T03:42:32.9389416Z`  
**Finding:** The earliest anomalous PowerShell activity appears at 03:42:32Z on Aug 19. Note the concurrent device-name spoofing (n4than-i3l-vm vs. n4thani3l-vm), which complicates host attribution and underscores the need to correlate across multiple telemetry types.  

---

### Flag 2: Local Account Assessment

**Objective:** Confirm local identity enumeration following initial foothold.  
**What to Hunt:** Account discovery queries and associated process hashes.  
**TTP:** Local account reconnaissance to stage impersonation and privilege escalation.  
**Why It Matters:** Early identity mapping signals intent to pivot privileges or blend with legitimate users.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Identify the associated SHA256 value***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where AccountName has_any ("n4th4n13l", "n4th4n-13l")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, SHA256, InitiatingProcessSHA256
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `9785001b0dcf755eddb8af294a373c0b87b2498660f724e76c4d53f9c217c7a3`  
**Finding:** Multiple account-name variants (n4th4n13l, n4th4n-13l, N4th4n13L) appear, indicating alias spoofing during enumeration. The associated SHA256 above ties the activity to a specific process lineage.  

---

### Flag 3: Privileged Group Assessment

**Objective:** Identify checks for elevated local administrators.  
**What to Hunt:** Group membership queries executed from PowerShell.  
**TTP:** Discovery of privileged groups to target admin accounts.  
**Why It Matters:** Reveals preparation for escalation and potential lateral movement.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Looking for the InitiatingCommandLine for privileged group***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "nathan-i3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("net","Get","who","local","admin","privilege","account","member","group")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCreationTime, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `"powershell.exe" net localgroup Administrators`  
**Finding:** The actor leverages PowerShell to invoke net localgroup Administrators, enumerating local admins and surfacing accounts of interest such as n4th4n13l.  

---

### Flag 4: Active Session Discovery

**Objective:** Identify enumeration of active sessions for potential piggybacking.  
**What to Hunt:** qwinsta or query session execution.  
**TTP:** Session discovery to blend operations with existing user contexts.  
**Why It Matters:** Riding live sessions reduces new-logon noise and helps evade detections.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Reveal active sessions for potential masking***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "nathan-i3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("qwinsta","query session")
| project FileName, InitiatingProcessFileName
```
**Output:** `qwinsta.exe`  
**Finding:** Use of qwinsta.exe confirms active session enumeration consistent with masquerading tactics.  

---

### Flag 5: Defender Configuration Recon

**Objective:** Detect tampering with Defender runtime protections masked as HR activity.  
**What to Hunt:** PowerShell commands modifying Defender preferences.  
**TTP:** Defense evasion via Set-MpPreference and payload staging.  
**Why It Matters:** Disabling real-time monitoring enables subsequent credential access and exfiltration with reduced telemetry.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Investigate AV disablement disguised as HR activity***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "n4thani3l-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("powershell","union","defender","get","preference")
| project Timestamp, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
**Output:** `"powershell.exe" -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true; Start-Sleep -Seconds 1; Set-Content -Path "C:\Users\Public\PromotionPayload.ps1" -Value "Write-Host 'Payload Executed'"`  
**Finding:** The actor bypasses execution policy, disables real-time monitoring, inserts a brief delay, and drops a staged payload to C:\Users\Public\PromotionPayload.ps1.  

---

### Flag 6: Defender Policy Modification

**Objective:** Validate registry-level weakening of baseline protections.  
**What to Hunt:** Defender-related registry values set to disable protections.  
**TTP:** Persistent defense evasion by policy modification.  
**Why It Matters:** Policy changes survive reboots and degrade long-term detection.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Registry change indicating Defender disablement***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "n4thani3l-vm"
| where RegistryValueName contains "disable"
| project Timestamp, RegistryValueName
```
**Output:** `DisableAntiSpyware`  
**Finding:** Setting DisableAntiSpyware indicates intentional reduction of Defender coverage beyond runtime toggles.  

---

### Flag 7: Access to Credential-Rich Memory Space

**Objective:** Confirm use of native tools to target credential-bearing memory.  
**What to Hunt:** rundll32 with comsvcs.dll and HR-themed file operations.  
**TTP:** LOLBin memory dump techniques masked as HR tooling.  
**Why It Matters:** Memory dumps often precede credential theft and lateral movement.  

**KQL Query:**

***// HR-themed LOLBin interaction with protected memory***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-05);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName contains "n4thani3l-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("comsvcs.dll","HRTool")
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ActionType
```
**Output:** `HRConfig.json`  
**Finding:** Activity referencing comsvcs.dll (via rundll32) and HR tooling correlates with artifacts written/read as HRConfig.json, aligning with credential-access tradecraft under business pretext.  

---

### Flag 8: File Inspection of Dumped Artifacts

**Objective:** Validate post-collection review of sensitive dump content.  
**What to Hunt:** Local tools opening HR-themed dump files.  
**TTP:** On-host verification of collected data prior to exfiltration.  
**Why It Matters:** Confirms successful collection and triage before staging.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Command-line access to the dump post-collection***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-19T03:59:55.835968Z);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("notepad","Get","Content","type")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `"notepad.exe" C:\HRTools\HRConfig.json`  
**Finding:** notepad.exe opens C:\HRTools\HRConfig.json, indicating on-host review of a sensitive HR-config artifact likely tied to a prior dump.  

---

### Flag 9: Outbound Communication Test

**Objective:** Identify non-standard outbound beacons used to verify egress.  
**What to Hunt:** Lightweight connectivity checks to atypical TLDs.  
**TTP:** External reachability testing prior to exfiltration.  
**Why It Matters:** Early beacons reveal planned exfiltration channels.  

**KQL Query:**

### Flag 11: Persistence via Local Scripting

**Objective:** Verify persistence established through legacy/autorun mechanisms.  
**What to Hunt:** Startup configurations invoking non-standard scripts.  
**TTP:** Registry Run/autorun persistence using HR-themed script names.  
**Why It Matters:** Ensures continuity of access under the guise of business tooling.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Identify executable/script tied to autorun-style registry value***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-19T04:37:45.2395387Z);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20T23:59:59);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("run","legacy")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `OnboardTracker.ps1`  
**Finding:** A legacy-themed autorun path references OnboardTracker.ps1, signaling script-based persistence masquerading as HR onboarding automation.

### Flag 12: Targeted File Reuse / Access

**Objective:** Surface the personnel file that drew repeated attention.  
**What to Hunt:** Multiple accesses to PII-bearing .txt files.  
**TTP:** Target validation and staging of personnel data for influence or extortion.  
**Why It Matters:** The repeatedly accessed file often reveals motive and target.  

**KQL Query:**

***// Identify repeatedly accessed personnel text files***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-19T04:46:06.5654042Z);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20T23:59:59);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains ".txt"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `Carlos Tanaka`  
**Finding:** Personnel entries show disproportionate access to Carlos Tanaka (six instances), distinguishing it from other one-off lookups.  

---

### Flag 13: Candidate List Manipulation

**Objective:** Detect tampering with promotion-related records.  
**What to Hunt:** Early modifications to promotion files and their hashes.  
**TTP:** Structured data manipulation prior to exfiltration.  
**Why It Matters:** Confirms staging and tampering tied directly to the promotion narrative.  

**KQL Query:**

***// First modification and SHA1 for promotion-related data***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-18T04:37:10.5471617Z);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20T23:59:59);
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where FileName contains "promotion"
| project Timestamp, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, SHA1
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** df5e35a8dcecdf1430af7001c58f3e9e9faafa05  
**Finding:** The earliest promotion-file modification (e.g., PromotionCandidates.csv) yields the SHA1 above, linking manipulation to the broader HR tampering timeline.

### Flag 14: Audit Trail Disruption

**Objective:** Find the first attempt to impair forensic visibility.  
**What to Hunt:** wevtutil usage and disabling/clearing event logs.  
**TTP:** Indicator removal via Windows Event Log operations.  
**Why It Matters:** Early log manipulation is a strong signal of anti-forensics intent.  

**KQL Query:**

***// First attempt to clear/disable logging***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-01T23:59:59);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-20T23:59:59);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where AccountName == "n4th4n13l"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("eventlog","clean","disab","wevtutil")
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```
**Output:** `2025-08-19T04:55:48.9660467Z`  
**Finding:** The first recorded anti-forensics action appears just before 05:00Z on Aug 19, with wevtutil-based log manipulation surfacing in command-line artifacts.

### Flag 15: Final Cleanup and Exit Prep

**Objective:** Capture the last anti-forensics attempt before the actor exits.  
**What to Hunt:** Deletions of artifacts (e.g., PowerShell history) and other cleanup.  
**TTP:** Trace removal and script history deletion to impede investigation.  
**Why It Matters:** The final cleanup timestamp helps cap the incident timeline.  

KQL Query:

***// Last timestamp for actor's file deletion activity***
```
let StartTime = datetime(2025-08-01T23:59:59);
let EndTime   = datetime(2025-08-31T23:59:59);
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp between (StartTime .. EndTime)
| where DeviceName == "n4thani3l-vm"
| where ActionType contains "delete"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```
**Output:** `2025-08-19T05:08:11.8528871Z`  
**Finding:** The last associated cleanup targets ConsoleHost_history.txt via PowerShell, aligning with a typical sequence of history and trace deletion immediately prior to exit.
